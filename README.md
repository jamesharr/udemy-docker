These are my notes from the [Docker and Kubernetes - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide) course.

It's really just a [Quick Reference](docs/QuickRef.md) for some of the concepts in the clasee.
This is not a substitute for the class itself. It's a really good class
and these notes only represent enough content to remember what's
possible or remember the exact syntax of commands.
